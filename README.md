
# Snowballin Grid Bot

A high-frequency DCA grid trading bot for Kraken, with Coingecko-based indicators, built for continuous deployment on a lightweight VPS (e.g., t2.medium). It auto-manages capital using volatility, trend, and RSI filters with full restart and recovery support.

## 🚀 About Snowballbot

Snowballbot began as a personal challenge: could I use AI to teach myself technical analysis — and then turn that knowledge into something autonomous? Six months later, this project became a reality: a fully AI-generated, market-adaptive trading strategist.

It’s designed for security and survivability (well, in terms of money anyway - I'm security minded but who knows what bugs are in this).

Kraken was chosen specifically because of its withdrawal key model — funds can't move unless your account is compromised and the destination is pre-approved.

I honestly didn’t expect this to work. But it is — at least for me. If it helps you too, that’s a win. This isn’t financial advice. It’s a tool. Use it at your own risk. There’s a donation wallet if Snowballbot earns its keep.

### 🧠 For the curious hacker:

This README holds just enough to get your hands dirty. It’s not about turnkey solutions — it’s about sparking ideas. AI isn’t just some passive chatbot. It’s leverage. It’s force multiplication. Use it to learn faster, automate deeper, and explore smarter.

## 🧪 Running the Bot
### 🔁 Daemonizing Snowballbot with `systemd` (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Create the systemd service file:
# Replace /path/to/snowballbot with your actual binary and working directory path.
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/snowballbot.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Snowballbot Trading Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/snowballbot
ExecStart=/path/to/snowballbot
Restart=on-failure
StandardOutput=append:/path/to/snowballbot.out
StandardError=append:/path/to/snowballbot.err

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Reload systemd, enable the service, and start it:
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable snowballbot
sudo systemctl start snowballbot

# Check logging:
journalctl -u snowballbot -f

# Commands to status/stop/start/restart manually
sudo systemctl status snowballbot.service
sudo systemctl stop snowballbot.service
sudo systemctl start snowballbot.service
sudo systemctl restart snowballbot.service

# Start tailing logs to watch bot
screen -S snowbotting
tail -f /path/to/snowballbot.err
# Detach: Ctrl+A then D, Reattach: `screen -x snowbot`
```
## 🔁 Restart & Recovery

- Rebuilds open positions by scanning Kraken trade history (last 24h)
- Filters out test trades, dust, and stale fills
- Falls back to midpoint price if history is unavailable
- Persists key state data: `AvgEntry`, `PositionVol`, `PriceHistory`, and `ProfitCumulative`

---

## 🧠 Tips

- ✅ Set a **custom nonce window** in your Kraken API key settings to avoid `EAPI:Invalid nonce` errors
- 📅 Trade reconstruction defaults to the **last 24h** — ensure your actual position aligns with that window
- 🎯 Snowballbot auto-adjusts for volatility, but you can override **RSI gates**, **slack**, and **grid spacing** per asset if needed
  - This line is accurate as long as users understand that configuration is optional, not mandatory.
- 🕒 **Batch price fetches** from Coingecko every **30–60 seconds** to stay within API rate limits
